### Date created
I created this project and README file on December 14, 2020.

### Project Title
Bikeshare Project

### Description
In this project, I explore data related to bike sharing systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
Using Python, I will write a code importing the data and answering interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

### Credits
It's important to give proper credit. Add links to any repo that inspired you or blogposts you consulted.
