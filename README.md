I created this project and README file on December 14, 2020.

### Project Title
Bikeshare Project

### Description
In this project, I explore data related to bike sharing systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
Using Python, I will write a code import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
